# ## Use SSH to help with automatic window naming
#
# Helpful code to add to ~/.ssh/config:
#
#     Host *
#     PermitLocalCommand yes
#     LocalCommand if [[ $TERM == screen* ]]; then printf "\033k%h\033\\"; fi
#
# When we sign in to a server, The code runs a command to print the server's
# local hostname with an escape sequence that triggers tmux to set the window title.
# If we open the list of windows (ctrl-a w) we see each window's server name.
# This is also the reason why I have automatic window renaming turned off.

# Some of our teammates pefer to unbind all keys first.
# This guarantees a clean slate. Use this if you want it.
##

# Unbind all keys
#unbind-key -a

##
# Make tmux use C-a for the hot key, instead of C-b.
#
# We prefer C-a because it's faster to type than C-b,
# and it's easy to type when we change the computer
# keyboard "Caps Lock" key to send "Control" instead.
#
# Some people prefer to use C-a because it's the same key
# that the `screen` multiplexer uses, and also easy to type.
##

# Set tmux prefix to Control-a
set -g prefix C-a

# Set 'C-a C-a' to type 'C-a'
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# Unset tmux prefix Control-b
unbind C-b

##
# Shell related settings
##

# Option 1: Set shell to zsh
set -g default-shell "/usr/local/bin/zsh"

# Option 2: set shell to use env var
#set -g default-shell "$SHELL"

# Option 1: on generic Unix systems, we prefer the zsh shell.
#set -g default-command "zsh"

# Reload the tmux conf file; this is useful when we edit as we go.
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display 'Config reloaded'

# Remember many command line history lines.
set -g history-limit 1000000

# Set the terminal type so colors get rendered correctly
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# Make switching to cmd mode in zsh quick.
set -s escape-time 0

# Sane scrolling
# set -g terminal-overrides 'xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@'
set -g terminal-overrides '\*:smcup@:rmcup@'

# ;: Command prompt
bind \; command-prompt

##
# Sessions
##

# Fast session switching, by prompting for the session name.
unbind S
bind S command-prompt "switch -t %1"

##
# Windows
##

# Shortcuts M-[0-9] to switch to window [0-9].
# These are a bit faster to use than C-a [0-9].
# We comment these out because we prefer using M-[0-9] in our editor.
#
#bind -n M-0 select-window -t :0
#bind -n M-1 select-window -t :1

# Split window horizontally or vertically

##
# Panes
##

# Start pane numbering at 1, because 1 makes more sense for keyboards.
set -g base-index 1

# Select pane similar to vi keybindings
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

##
# Change a pane to a window by using + then back to a pane by using -.
# This can be helpful for native mouse copy-paste, which tends to work
# when the item is in a window, but doesn't work when the item is in a pane.
##
